# Second post

This is yet another post detailing what I've just learned

## Section

This is going to be a list:

- first item
- second item

This is a block of code

```scala
package com.rockthejvm.staticsite

object PersonalWebsite {
  def renderBlog() = {
    // render an HTML
    // contain links to other HTML pages built out of Markdown blog posts
  }

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    renderBlog()
  }
}
```
